Cycling and cardiovascular health: A UK-wide ecological study of the relationship between cycling prevalence and cardiovascular disease markers

What is known:
* Physical activity reduces blood pressure, overweight, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk at the individual level 
* Cycling vs public transport vs car impacts on local and global environment
* Air pollution exacerbates risk of CHD
* CHD costs the health service and the economy to the tune of 12% of European and Canadian healthcare costs (Tarride et al 2009) and 17% of US health expenditure (Heidenreich et al 2011)
What this study can add:
* Understanding of whether, at the population level, physical activity achieved through active transport may be associated with reduced burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality

Background
Studies from in middle income and high income countries, and in rural and urban settings have investigated the association between active travel and heart disease or proxy measures of heart disease risk. Population level studies show association between higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of cardiovascular risk. For example, a prospective cohort study of 23000 Dutch adults used a questionnaire to assess physical activity, and cardiovascular disease incidence at follow up after an average of 9.8 years. The hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease was 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in those engaged in cycling, but a dose response relationship was not identified. Walking was not associated with lower cardiovascular disease hazard ratio at 10 year follow up. Results were adjusted for age, sex, other physical activities, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational level (Hoevenaar-Blom MP et al. 2011). This correlates with findings from *physiological studies* which demonstrate that physical activity reduces the risk of overweight, hypertension and cardiovascular risk [REFs, e.g. Goldberg et al.]. 
A retrospective cohort study used data from a national survey of UK residents (n=XX)  in 2009-2011 to investigate the association between active transport and overweight, obesity, hypertension and diabetes in different socio-demographic groups. This study included public transport, walking and cycling in the definition of active transport and used logistic regression methods. Across all groups, active transport was associated with a likelihood of being overweight (AOR 0.80 (0.54-0.88)) and walking was associated with a lower likelihood of having hypertension (AOR 0.83 (0.71-0.97)) (Laverty et al, 2013). A retrospective cohort study of US 9933 adults taken from 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data classified participants by amount of active transportation and used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses to investigate relationship with mean waist circumference and BMI. The study found a dose-response relationship; participants with low and high levels of active transport had lower BMI (-0.9 (95% CI -1.4, -0.5) and -1.2 (95% CI -1.7, -0.8) respectively), mean waist circumference (-2.2cm (95% CI -3.2, -1.2) and -3.1cm (95% CI -4.3, -1.9)) and likelihood of hypertension (AOR=0.76 (95% CI 0.61, 0.94) and AOR=0.69 (95% CI 0.58, 0.83)) compared to those reporting no active transport. High active transport level was associated lower likelihood of being diabetic (AOR=0.69 (95% CI 0.54, 0.88)), but no association was seen with high-density lipoprotein level. The study controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, and minutes/week of physical activity not related to transport (Furie and Desai 2012). 
A retrospective cardiovascular study investigated the relationship between active travel to neighbourhood amenities (e.g. parks) and BMI, waist circumference and cardiovascular fitness in 3547 participants. Analysis was with multivariable linear or multinomial regression models, stratified by gender. More participants walked than cycled to neighbourhood amenities, factors such as having a partner or having children were associated with lower likelihood of using active transport. Walking or cycling were associated with more favorable BMI (-1.68 (95%CI -2.81, -0.55), waist circumference (-3.41cm (95%CI -5.71, -1.11)) and treadmill test duration (36.65seconds (95%CI (17.99, 55.31)). (Boone-Heinonen et al. 2009)
In middle income countries, similar results are seen. A retrospective cohort study of 8400 adults in China supports the association between lower likelihood of obesity and walking or cycling for transport, but found that walking or cycling was associated with increased likelihood of having diabetes or high cholesterol. This study collected travel data using participant interviews, and carried out physiological and biochemical tests. (Lu et al. 2013).  A retrospective cohort study of women in China found inverse relationships between cycling for transport and all-cause mortality and walking for transport and all-cause mortality, although the latter was not significant (p=0.07) (Matthews et al 2007). A cross-sectional study of 1,366 rural and 2,536 urban participants in India used random-effect logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, caste, standard of living, occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity, daily fat intake, smoking status, and alcohol use, and found adjusted risk ratios of for overweight/obesity of 0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.88) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.55-0.77) for walking and cycling to work respectively, compared to using private motor transport. Cycling to work compared to using private transport was associated with an adjusted risk ration of 0.51 (95% CI 0.36-0.71) for hypertension and 0.65 (95% CI 0.44-0.95) for diabetes (Millet et al 2013). Like the USA study by Furie and Desai (2012), this study provides evidence of a dose response relationship between active transport and reduction in cardiovascular risk.
There is evidence that the benefits of active travel may be more beneficial to some socio-demographic groups than others. For example, an RCT involving overweight men (n=60) and women (n=71) all aged 61-79 years found that about 40 minutes of cycling, an average of 2.5 times per week resulted in an average 10.6 and 5.5 mmHg reduction in blood pressure, and XX and XX reduction in body mass index in the groups respectively (Morita and Okita 2013). At the population level active travel is found to have more health benefits in urban residents than rural residents (Millet et al 2013). (Laverty et al – more uptake of walking in black ethnicity participants) A cross sectional study of 344 10-year old children in USA at two time periods, six years apart suggests that the association between active transport and cardiovascular risk holds seen in adults is also present in children (Anderson et al 2011). 

Aims 
- To explore the relationship between cardiovascular disease and prevalence of active transport at population level in order to inform policy making 
- To explore confounding or moderating factors that may influence this relationship, including socioeconomic status, smoking prevalence, (gender, ethnicity and urbanity)
Objectives
- Obtain data on prevalence of active transport, average distance travelled per person using active transport, under 75 cardiovascular mortality rate, prevalence of hospital admission for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), median blood pressure, prevalence of high blood pressure, prevalence of diabetes, median BMI, prevalence of overweight or obesity, prevalence of  smoking and socioeconomic status at the unitary authority (UA) and district level in the UK
- Correlate active travel to work (the explanatory variable) with cardiovascular disease measures (the outcome variable)
- Explore the impact of  potential confounding or  mediating factors: socioeconomic status, smoking prevalence and prevalence of diabetes, overweight and obesity
- Explore/validate the correlation between prevalence of active transport/average distance travelled per person using public transport and population physical activity levels using the data on “percentage of physically active adults” from PHE
