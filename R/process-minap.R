# Create age bands [may want to change these to 5 or 10 year age bands???]
# Whatever way we choose, we will need to join on M/LSOA population level data to match this
subset_data$age_band <- cut(subset_data[, "age"], c(-1, 15.5, 24.5, 34.5, 44.5, 54.5, 64.5, 74.5, 121),

# Aggregate counts to M/LSOAs
dt <- data.table(subset_data)
data <- dt[, list(admissions=.N), by = c("sex", "age_band", "MSOA")]

## Join on population data in same format here based on M/LSOA data (RL)
data$population = rnorm(n = nrow(data), mean = 8000, sd = 5000)

### Create expected counts ###


# Aggregate counts by age and sex to calcuate the 'standard population'
std_pop <- dt[, list(admissions=.N, population=sum(data$population)), by = c("sex", "age_band")]

# Calculate age- and sex-specific rates
std_pop <- as.data.frame(std_pop)
std_pop$adm_rate <- std_pop$admissions / std_pop$population
std_pop$population <- NULL
std_pop$admissions <- NULL

# Join the age- and sex-specific rates onto the data
data2 <- join(data, std_pop, by = c("sex", "age_band"), type = "left", match = "first")

# Calcuate expected rate
data2$adm_expt <- data2$adm_rate * data2$population

## What we want left is a file for M/LSOAs disaggregated by sex and age-bands with counts of
## admissions and the expected count of admissions. We can later aggregate by sex (or for total
## persons) the counts but better to keep disaggregated for now
